/**
 * Gesture etiquette: the few places ovvar has to hold still while Danse is animating a stand-in.
 *
 * <p>Danse plays a gesture by hiding the real player — an empty equipment packet to every watcher
 * and the invisible flag — and animating a puppet of item displays built from the equipment it
 * took <em>once</em>, at the start. Ovvar re-sends equipment on a schedule of its own
 * ({@link Combos#packLoaded} after a pack load, {@link OvveFeet} when a viewer's cuff dye changes),
 * and either of those would re-dress the invisible player in the middle of the gesture. So both
 * ask here first.
 *
 * <p>It is also the gate for the rest of the package. Danse types are named only here (inside
 * {@link Impl}), in {@link DanseCompat}, {@link DanseLayers} and {@link DanseModels}, none of which
 * load until {@link #active()} has said Danse is here, so a server without Danse never verifies a
 * class that mentions it. The body layers need <em>our fork</em> of Danse
 * ({@code libs/danse/NOTICE.txt}); upstream Danse has the same mod id but not the API, and gets the
 * etiquette only ({@link #mode}). The system property {@code ovvar.danse.compat=false} turns the
 * whole layer off (this and {@link DanseMixinPlugin} read the same flag), which is how the "before"
 * screenshot is taken.

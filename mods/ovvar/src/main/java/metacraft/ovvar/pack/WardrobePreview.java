/**
 * The wardrobe screen's preview: the player's whole ovve — top and trousers as one figure — drawn
 * in the screen's title, from four sides, and turned by the buttons at the end of the tab row.
 *
 * <p>A vanilla client cannot draw an entity inside a chest screen, so the preview is a
 * <em>paper doll</em>: the humanoid model's faces, cut out of the very equipment-layer textures
 * the client draws the garment with, laid out flat as a standing figure. Front and back show the
 * arms beside the torso and the legs below it; a side shows the body's own side face with the
 * sleeve beside it and the trouser leg below, which is where that side's cells are.
 *
 * <p><b>It is built up in layers, not baked per design.</b> One glyph per (chapter, angle) draws
 * the bare garment, and one small glyph per (patch, cell, angle) draws that patch exactly where it
 * lands on the doll — cropped to its own art, so the glyph is a dozen pixels square, and placed by
 * space advances and its ascent. The title stacks the bare ovve and then one glyph per sewn
 * placement, so a design is composed at the moment the screen opens: the pack holds a fixed
 * {@code chapters × 4 + Σ patches-per-cell × 1} glyphs, never grows with what anybody sews, and
 * nothing has to be regenerated or pushed when a patch goes on. A cell is on exactly one face of
 * one box, and a face is seen from exactly one of the four angles, so a cell has exactly one glyph
 * per patch — and the cells you cannot see from an angle simply have none.
 *
 * <p>Sizes: the source textures hold {@link Spot#DETAIL} texels per skin pixel and the doll is
 * drawn at {@value #PX} screen px per skin pixel, so every face is resampled ×1.5 (which keeps
 * every texel the patch art has, at the price of every other column being 2 px wide). The bare
 * doll is shaded — the viewer's right darker, either arm darker again, a seam at the waist — and
 * given a 1 px dark outline drawn on its own outermost pixels, so it reads as a figure and not as
 * a strip of faces; a patch layer takes the same shading, and keeps off the outline's own pixels so
 * a patch at the edge of a sleeve cannot break the figure's edge.

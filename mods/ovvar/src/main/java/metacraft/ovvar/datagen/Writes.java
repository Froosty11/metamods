 * The two ways anything of ours is ever written into {@code src/main/generated} — a JSON document
 * and a PNG — and the futures the run has to wait on before it may say it is finished. One of
 * these belongs to one {@link DataProvider#run} call: it holds that call's {@link CachedOutput},
 * which is the cache deciding whether a file whose bytes have not changed is touched at all, so a
 * provider makes a fresh one each run rather than clearing a field it shares between runs.
 *
 * <p>There is nothing clever here, and that is the point: both providers in this package wrote
 * these six lines out separately, which is six lines for a hash algorithm and a wrapping of
 * {@link IOException} to drift apart in — and a PNG written two ways is a PNG whose cache entry
 * two runs disagree about.
